<h1>What's happening in Palestine</h1>

<img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/imagecache/mbdxxlarge/mritems/Images/2020/5/16/5d4588922a1a4fe6851fb69891d7aa3c_18.jpg" alt="conflict in Palestine" width = "700" height = 400>  
 
<p> The Palestine and Israel conflict is one of the longest running conflict's in the world. The two opposing movements are the Palestinian nationalist project and the Jewish Zionist project. There is conflict between the Israeli Jews and Palestinian's because both want the same land as it is important to both. 
    The conflict began in the early 20th Century when Jews were fleeing persecution in Europe. They wanted to establish their own national homeland in the territory of the Ottoman and then the British Empire.
    The Muslim arabs refused this as the land was rightfully theirs, their was an early UN plan to give both groups parts of the territory but this failed leading to several wars over the land. The two most important one were in 1948 and 1967.
    In 1967 the outcome left Israel in control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, btoh aread home to large Palestinian populations. However in the present the West Bank is controlled by the Palestinian Authority but subject to Israeli occupation, enforcing strict restrictions on Palestenian movement,
    continously expanding the land for Israeli settlers whilst destroying Palestinian communities. 

    Many have suggested a two-state solution: estavlish Palestine as an independent state in Gaza with most of the West Bank, with the rest of the land belonging to Israel. However this is highly unlikely to work in practice. 

</p>

<p> To understand the conflict we also have to look at Zionism: Israel's national ideology. Zionists are people who believe Judaism is a nationality and religion, therefore saying Jews need their own state in Israel - which they regard as ancestral homeland. 
    This is because Jews often trace their nationhood back to the kingdoms of David and Solomon (around 950 BC). 
    A key player in bringing about Zionism was Theodor Herzl, an Austrian-Jewish journalist.
He witnessed brutal anti-semitism firsthand, and became convinced that Jews couldn't survive outisde of a country of their own. He organised meetings and wrote essays that increased mass Jewish emigration from Europe to Palestine. Before him about 20 000 Jews lived there and by the time Adolf Hitler rose to power there was 8 times this number. 
  </p>

<p> A key party is the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO).They nationally represent Palestinian's and run the government - the Palestinian National Authority (PA) in the West Bank but not Gaza.
Gaza is governed by Hamas - a Palestinian Islamist political and militant organisation that has waged war on Israel since 1987. However Hamas and PLO are currently not united as talks between them have repeatedly broken down. 
There are many issues with the treatment of Palestinians as Israel continues to impose institutionalised discrimiation against them in Occupied Palestinian territories, they have killed many Palestinians including children during demonstration and protests and these continue to the present day.  </p>
