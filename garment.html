<p> The Bangladesh garment industry has been problematic for a long time. 
    Currently 3.5-4 million people are employed in the industry, many poor and overworked. 
    Whilst there have been incidents and fires in the factories before, the major turning point was the collapse of the Rana Plaza facotry complex in 2013. 
    In this horrific incident 1132 lives were lost and more than 2500 people were injured. This sparked a global campaign for change leading to the formation 
    of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh (AFBS) and the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety (ABWS).

<p>However whilst these organsitions have helped there are still many unprotected factories. For example many export factories don't have a direct relationship with large western buyers so they're unlikely to be protected. Furthermore the ABWS ceased all it's operations on December 31st 2018 as it was only
    a 5 year agreement. Whilst the AFBS will continue it's operations until May 31st 2021 and then hand over all work to a national regulatory body run by the Bangladeshi government. However a larger international approach is needed as many things are tied into this industry such as fast fashion. Furthermore
    due to Covid-19 many brands have left their workers unpaid, even though they can support them but have chosen not to so they can maximise their profits. This is an even larger reason why a global approach should be considered as these workers have a right to a safe workplace where they can also benefit and earn the wages they desrve to support themselves and their families.
